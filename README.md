# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on available information like Age, Gender, Passenger Class, Fare, etc.

##  Dataset

- Dataset provided as part of internship task.
- Contains features such as:
  - PassengerId
  - Survived
  - Pclass
  - Name
  - Sex
  - Age
  - SibSp
  - Parch
  - Ticket
  - Fare
  - Cabin
  - Embarked

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

##  Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
   - Encoding categorical variables (Sex, Embarked)
3. **Model Building**
   - Logistic Regression model trained
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report

##  Results

- Final Accuracy: **81%**
- Good balance of Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

##  How to Run

- Download the `.ipynb` notebook.
- Open it in Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook.
- Run all cells in sequence.

##  Future Improvements

- Try other algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost for higher accuracy.
- Tune hyperparameters.
- Handle missing data more creatively.
